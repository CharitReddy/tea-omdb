### `App Functionality`

## Home Page
Home page has a search bar initially, and displays a grid of cards with basic details of movies once searched.

### Search Bar
Search is triggered when a pause of 1s is detected in between 2 consecutive keystrokes, or when enter is hit, or when search icon is clicked.
The clear button at the end clears the search and current results.

### List
When any card in the grid is clicked, a Dialog opens displaying all the details of the movie. The dialog has a fixed title on top and close button on bottom, and the rest of the content is scrollable.

### Pages
The limit for number of movies displayed at once is 10, and pages are available on the bottom of home page to view further results.
A new search will always start from Page 1 irrespective of current page.

### `Technical Details`
-All the components and icons used are from Material UI.
-The search functionality is Debounced. Search is not triggered for every change in user input, rather triggers on a pause of at least 1000ms/1s.
-Pagination is implemented as per the API response, with number of pages being total/10. Although the API documentation states valid range for pages is 1-100, pages greater than 100 seem to work fine too.
-All JSX is present in the folders Pages and Components according to the hierarchy.
--Entire business logic is present in the useHome hook inside src/pages/Home.
-The services folder has both BySearch and ByID API calls as functions.
-The utils folder has any reusable functions not specific to any of the above functionality.
-The commons folder has interfaces being used at more than a single place.
-The translations folder has a translate function that accepts keys as input and displays the corresponding text from a given language file.
-Only en.ts is present, and although change in language has not been implemented, it can easily be switched. A new language file has to be provided. If it has to be dynamic, a context/global state can be used to switch between the languages.
